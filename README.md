# 3110-final

Final project for 3110

The system will present an interface, most likely implemented on the terminal, that shows the chess board in the current game state. The game will allow for valid moves with reasonable syntax for instance “D6 to D7” to represent a move from position “D6” to position “D7”. The game will provide warnings when a player is in check, and will display victory messages upon a win.
