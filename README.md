# 3110-final

Final project for 3110

The system will present an interface, most likely implemented on the terminal, that shows the chess board in the current game state. The game will allow for valid moves with reasonable syntax for instance “D6 to D7” to represent a move from position “D6” to position “D7”. The system should provide reasonable descriptiveness when rejecting an invalid move, for instance citing a rule that is violated. The game will provide warnings when a player is in check, and will display victory messages upon a win.
